***Project Overview:

This project aims to forecast daily Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi using multiple machine learning and deep learning models. Emphasis was placed on both prediction accuracy and explainability using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to identify the most influential pollutants affecting AQI levels.

***Models Developed:

  1. Linear Regression

  2. Random Forest

  3. Support Vector Regression (SVR)

  4. XGBoost

  5. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)


***Evaluation Metrics:

Models were evaluated using the following metrics:

1. RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

2. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

3. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)



***Explainability with SHAP:
SHAP was used to interpret the best-performing stacked ensemble model, highlighting the impact of individual pollutants on AQI forecasts. This helped in identifying key pollutants and understanding the model's decision-making process.


***Tech Stack:

1. Python

2. Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, XGBoost

***SHAP for model interpretability:

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
